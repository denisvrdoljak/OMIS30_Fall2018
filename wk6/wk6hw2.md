# OMIS 30: Week 6, HW 2


## Classes and Inheritance 

Write a Pig class. Then, create two child classes (inherit from the Pig class) for WildHog and FarmPig. WildHog should be able to charge/attack. FarmPig should be able to sleep. Make sure all classes have a species, a name, and at least 2 methods. (To keep things simple, do not use hidden attributes.) 

All pigs can Oink and Eat (so these should be part of the parent class). It's up to you how you impliment these methods, and what they do.
