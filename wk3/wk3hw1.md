## This is the Loop that never Ends...

Create a standalone python script (.py file, not a .ipynb notebook) that asks a user for an input, does something (eg, prints user's input) repeatedly in an infinite loop, but quits if the first letter of the user input is a 'q' or a 'Q'
Submit your .py file via Camino. Include your name as part of the filename.
Submit the command to run your file as a separate .txt (text) file.
