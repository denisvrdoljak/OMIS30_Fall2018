# Week 4

This folder contains a copy of the definitions of the objects for the card game we made up last week as a class activity. *You do not need to know how these work or how to create Classes. You DO need to know how to use objects and dot notation--which these provide simple examples of.* The actual game, that you guys wrote, is in "cardgame.py." (I edited the print statements and inserted a real random number generator. The rest was all you!)
